#  Our Goals

* Enable frontend developers to avoid writing backend code 
* Help Drupal stay relevant by keeping up with the pace of frontend innovation
* We want to stay relevant, too!
* We're not waiting for Drupal 8

Let's give frontend developers the ability to skate where the puck is going. No part of the Internet moves faster.

At the same time, we need to give stakeholders the tool they already like to use.
