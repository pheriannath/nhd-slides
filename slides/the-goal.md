#  The Goal

Assume the following:

* Frontend developers (usually) don't want to write PHP
* Drupal can't keep up with the pace of frontend innovation
* Stay relevant - both Drupal and us.
* We want it now. (we're not waiting for Drupal 8)

Let's give frontend developers the ability to skate where the puck is going. No part of the Internet moves faster than the frontend.

At the same time, we need to give stakeholders the tool they already like to use. We like keeping our jobs, after all.
