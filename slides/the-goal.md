#  The Goal

Assume the following:

* Frontend developers don't want to write PHP
* Drupal can't keep up with the pace of frontend innovation
* We want it now. (we're not waiting for Drupal 8)

Let's give frontend developers the ability to skate where the puck is going. No part of the Internet innovates faster than the frontend.

At the same time, we need to give stakeholders the tool they already like to use. We like keeping our jobs, after all.
