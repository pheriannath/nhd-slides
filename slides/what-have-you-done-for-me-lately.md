##  What have you done for me lately?

* Views Datasource is a cool idea, but its field handling is fundamentally flawed. 
* How do we make Drupal talk to Google?
* Can we optimize the content Drupal renders for Google?

## Meet the NHD Suite

1. NHD JSON - a re-write of Views Datasource based on Entity API.
2. NHD SEO - handles hashbang crawler requests via hook_boot.
3. NHD Theme - used by NHD SEO to output content with zero JS/CSS and as little markup as possible.

Currently in Drupal Sandboxes:
