##  That's Crazy! But What About Drupal?

Jay sat down, had a talk with Drupal... "You're going to behave, even if I have to code on you to make it happen".

Turns out, there has been much coding. (but more on that later).

One *__very__* long night later - I had Drupal 7 providing JSON to some custom Angular services I wrote, populating almost the entire site with test content.

Yes - this was working overnight. Turns out, the way we approached this, it's not difficult.
