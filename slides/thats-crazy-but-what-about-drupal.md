##  Ok, But What About Drupal?

I knew it might be a bumpy ride, but I was committed to helping Drupal along in this endeavor.

One long night later - I had Drupal 7 + contrib providing JSON to some custom Angular services I wrote, populating almost the entire site with test content. It wasn't perfect, but it was functional.

I've had to do quite a bit of coding in contrib, but it has gone much better than my initial expectations.
