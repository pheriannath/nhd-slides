##  Enough Talk, What Did You Build?

For our first attempt at this, we decided to re-engineer our own website, [Liveaxle.com](http://www.ohnoitsnotlaunchedsadface.com).

Jay literally said this: "Just build the frontend however you see fit."

So I built an AngularJS application. Our design team really wanted to do a shifty masonry layout, so I dropped Isotope.js in. Since this was all done without Drupal, I was able to get a proof-of-concept done in about a day and a half.
