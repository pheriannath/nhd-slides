##  Headless Drupal

Put simply, it's Drupal minus the theme layer, which is no fun to work with. 

...but you already knew that.

Put more verbosely:

>A movement to de-couple the Drupal CMS from front end development - 
>allowing front end developers the freedom to use next generation javascript 
>frameworks (Angular, Ember, etc) to build advanced AJAX based applications. 

Take what Drupal does best (Data), mix in a JSON API for that exotic flavor, then let the frontend engineers go nuts. (We &lt;3 AngularJS)

Problem solved! Let's all go get drinks.
