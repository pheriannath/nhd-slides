So we have our Javascript MVC based website. It gets data from Drupal via JSON. We have Drupal, it can render things. We may not like it, but it can render things. Guess what the Google wants? Rendered things.

We're using Drupal for Data, and we're using Drupal for rendering, but we're not using Drupal's rendering for the end user. We only use Drupal's theme system to appease the one that brings the users to us.
