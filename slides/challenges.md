##  Challenges

- Complex business objects in Drupal will need sub-API's written to expose them (FormAPI, Commerce, Translation, etc.)
- Administration: no integration with contextual links (I think it could be written though!), relies on Drupal admin to add/edit content
- Routing: careful considerations must be made to keep your MVC framework happy with Drupal aliasing
- Not really suited to the "site in a box" sort of product
- You tell us!
