##  So What is This Good For?

Lots of things! (We hope).

* Integrating Javascript MVC frameworks with Drupal
* Providing rendered, flat HTML to search engines
* Now you can animate ALL OF THE THINGS (Our designers love this)
* Write the HTML you want to see, without theme hooks...
* ...so no more *__ohmygod--thisishorrible--whoengineeredthis.tpl.php__* files!
